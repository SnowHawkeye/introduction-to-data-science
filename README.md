# Introduction course to data science

## Introduction
This course was first taught in september - october 2023 at [Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille](https://centralelille.fr/en/). 
It was created for Master's students who had little to no prior experience with Data Science.
This course aims to equip students with the fundamental theoretical and practical knowledge in data science and machine learning, empowering them to build upon this foundation for further learning and exploration.

This repository contains all the course material -- one set of slides and one jupyter notebook per lesson, with rare exceptions. All required datasets are also included.
Slides are mostly illustrative, as explanations were given orally. If you have any questions, suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out!

## Course outline

### Part 1: Data Preparation
1. _Understanding data_: What is data? Course introduction and fundamental concepts
2. _Collaborative development_: An introduction to Git, GitHub and version control systems
3. _Managing missing data_: What to do when your data is riddled with holes (removal, imputation, and other techniques)
4. _Dimensionality reduction_: How to reduce the amount of features (feature selection, PCA, etc.)
5. _Imbalanced data and deidentification_: Two very important concerns when dealing with healthcare data (resampling, SMOTE, etc.)
6. _Working with text_: An introduction to natural language processing (NLP)

### Part 2: Machine Learning
1. _Regression_: Algorithms to infer values
2. _Supervised classification_: Classic algorithms to differentiate cat pictures from dog pictures (KNN, SVM, etc.)
3. _Clustering_: Grouping similar data (K-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.)
4. _Decision trees_: Focus on a powerful algorithm (decision trees, random forests, etc.)
5. _Neural networks_: The basics of neural networks
6. _Advanced neural networks_: Focus on some recent architectures (CNN, GAN, etc.)
7. _Reinforcement learning_: Letting agents learn from their own mistakes (introduction to the main concepts)
