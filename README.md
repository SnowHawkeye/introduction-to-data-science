# Introduction course to data science

## Introduction
This course was first taught in september - october 2023 at [Ã‰cole Centrale de Lille](https://centralelille.fr/en/). 
It was created for Master's students who had little to no prior experience with Data Science.
This course aims to equip students with the fundamental theoretical and practical knowledge in data science and machine learning, upon which they can build with further studies and practical experiences.

This repository contains all the course material -- one set of slides and one jupyter notebook per lesson, with rare exceptions. All required datasets are also included.

Slides are mostly illustrative, as explanations were given orally. Practicals, however, should be self-explanatory.
If you have any questions, suggestions or comments, feel free to reach out!
